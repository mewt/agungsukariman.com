## Tracking Setup
- GA4 and server-side tagging architectures that capture the right events from day one  
- Conversion APIs, consent mode, and cross-domain tracking that stay compliant  
- Analytics QA so platforms, CRMs, and warehouses tell the same story

## Reporting Automation
- Dashboards built on Looker Studio, BigQuery, or the tools your operators already use  
- Data pipelines, scripts, and alerts that keep metrics fresh without the manual grind  
- Campaign, finance, and product views tailored to how your leadership reads performance

## Ad Optimisation
- Media mix reviews that connect creative, targeting, and spend to business outcomes  
- Experiment frameworks that blend platform data with first-party signals  
- Monthly and quarterly optimisation loops that surface what to scale and what to stop
