## Ramadhan Stories
A few months back, around Ramadan, I stumbled into an anime I totally misjudged.  
Thought it was some weird horror or action thing (title had *Orb* in it, so yeah, I expected punching or blood or something like that).  

Turns out... it was about **geocentric vs. heliocentric theory**.  
Earth-centered vs. Sun-centered.  
And the madness people faced when they tried to prove something the world wasn’t ready to accept.

Didn’t expect to feel anything.  
Instead, I got wrecked.

## It felt too real
Watching someone dedicate their **entire life** to a truth and still get rejected ... damn.  
That broke something inside me.  
It felt too real. Like the kind of pain you can’t argue with: the pain of being *right*, too early.

## My Mind went elsewhere
And suddenly, my mind went elsewhere.  
I started thinking about **Prophet Muhammad ﷺ**.

He wasn’t trying to prove planets move.  
He was trying to **guide hearts**.

## Things we're still figuring out
He didn’t come with formulas or telescopes.  
But the Qur’an talks about the **cosmos**, the **heavens**, the **universe expanding**, and yeah ... 
things we’re still figuring out.

And then there’s **Isra Mi’raj**.  
A journey through the heavens.  
Outside of time, outside of reason, and yet... it happened.  
He came back with prayer. Not theories.

And I thought:  
> He could’ve had peace. A quiet life.  
> But he chose the heavy path .. for us.

## Science & Faith
That anime made me feel a lot.  
Like... science and faith don’t have to fight.  
Sometimes they meet.  
In a verse. In a telescope. In a broken moment.  
Or yeah, even in some random anime at 2AM during Ramadan 😅

> Truth, whether uncovered through research, or held by faith,  
> it's still truth  
> and it still shines.

Thanks for being here.  
That moment during Ramadan still lingers in my head.  
Sometimes, the most meaningful things come from places you weren’t even looking.

still me,
