A few months back, around Ramadan, I stumbled into an anime I totally misjudged.  
Thought it was some weird horror or action thing (title had *Orb* in it, so yeah, I expected punching or blood or something like that).  

Turns out... it was about **geocentric vs. heliocentric theory**.  
Earth-centered vs. Sun-centered.  
And the madness people faced when they tried to prove something the world wasnâ€™t ready to accept.

Didnâ€™t expect to feel anything.  
Instead, I got wrecked.

Watching someone dedicate their **entire life** to a truth and still get rejected ... damn.  
That broke something inside me.  
It felt too real. Like the kind of pain you canâ€™t argue with â€” the pain of being *right*, too early.

And suddenly, my mind went elsewhere.  
I started thinking about **Prophet Muhammad ï·º**.

He wasnâ€™t trying to prove planets move.  
He was trying to **guide hearts**.

He didnâ€™t come with formulas or telescopes.  
But the Qurâ€™an talks about the **cosmos**, the **heavens**, the **universe expanding**, and yeah ... 
things weâ€™re still figuring out.

And then thereâ€™s **Isra Miâ€™raj**.  
A journey through the heavens.  
Outside of time, outside of reason, and yet... it happened.  
He came back with prayer. Not theories.

And I thought:  
> He couldâ€™ve had peace. A quiet life.  
> But he chose the heavy path .. for us.

That anime made me feel a lot.  
Like... science and faith donâ€™t have to fight.  
Sometimes they meet.  
In a verse. In a telescope. In a broken moment.  
Or yeah, even in some random anime at 2AM during Ramadan ðŸ˜…

> Truth â€” whether uncovered through research, or held by faith â€”  
> it's still truth  
> and it still shines.

Thanks for being here.  
That moment during Ramadan still lingers in my head.  
Sometimes, the most meaningful things come from places you werenâ€™t even looking.

still me,
