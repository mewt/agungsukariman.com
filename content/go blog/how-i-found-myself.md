## Why It Wasn’t What I Expected

For as long as I can remember, I thought life was supposed to follow a straight line. You pick a dream when you’re young—astronaut, architect, rockstar, whatever—and then you chase it down, step by step. That’s what we’re told, anyway.

But here’s what nobody tells you: most of us end up *somewhere completely different*. We blink, years pass, and suddenly we’re not the people we once imagined.

## Staring at the Mirror (And Not Recognizing Who’s There)

I’ve had more than a few moments where I looked in the mirror and thought, “Who is this?”  
Not in a dramatic, movie-meltdown kind of way—just a quiet, subtle sense of not recognizing the version of myself looking back.

Every era of my life feels like it belonged to a different person:
- The one who thought he’d be an esports player or a band player.
- The one who ended up in digital marketing, which was never on my vision board.
- The one who got back into coding after years away.
- The cyclist, chasing sunrise rides and sore legs instead of… whatever I thought adulthood was supposed to be.

## The Unexpected Turns

I never set out to be a digital marketer.  
I didn’t imagine I’d be the kind of person who finds joy in analytics dashboards or debugging someone’s messy code at midnight.  
And I *definitely* never saw myself obsessing over cycling gear, logging kilometers like I was training for the Tour de France.

Sometimes I wonder if I’m living in someone else’s body—a stranger who just happens to share my name and a few old memories.

## Losing and Finding “You”

Songs like Bowie’s *The Man Who Sold the World* or Gotye’s *Somebody That I Used to Know* hit me because they’re about exactly this:  
Looking back and seeing a stranger in your own story. Wondering if you “sold out,” or just grew up. If you lost control, or simply changed.  
We all become “somebody I used to know” at some point, and that’s okay.

## The Truth: You’re Always Becoming

If I’ve learned anything, it’s this: **finding yourself isn’t a destination.**  
It’s a constant, messy, beautiful process of *becoming*—letting go of the old versions and meeting the new ones, over and over.

Some days I miss the person I thought I’d be.  
Most days, though, I’m grateful for the one I’ve become—even if I had no idea he was coming.

Because in the end, you don’t find yourself all at once.  
You find yourself a little bit every day, in every surprise, every detour, every mirror.
