I signed up for the Jakarta 150 KM audax thinking it would be a vibe—steady pace, friendly checkpoints, maybe an iced kopi at halfway. Instead, the sun clocked in early and refused to clock out. By kilometer 20 the heat was pinning me to the asphalt, every pedal stroke a reminder that I could tap out any time.

The route didn’t help. Whoever traced the GPX must love chaos because the course dove into muddy backroads that grabbed at tires and shoes like quicksand. My drivetrain protested until the chain finally snapped, a metallic *thunk* that rattled me harder than any climb. I patched it together with greasy fingers and a spare link, cursing every puddle hiding jagged gravel.

Somewhere near Bekasi the rear tire went soft. No neutral support, no sag wagon—just me, the sun, and a puncture kit that suddenly felt too small. I burned through CO₂, reseated the bead, and watched other riders fade into the shimmer ahead. Unsupported means exactly that: no one is coming.

I kept moving because stopping meant melting. The heat turned every traffic light into a personal interrogation. Why are you here? Who asked you to suffer? Somewhere between the questions and the sweat, the answer showed up: I didn’t need hype, company, or perfect roads. I just needed stubborn legs and a promise to myself.

Jakarta peeled me apart that day—mud, busted chain, flattened tire, zero backup. But crossing the final checkpoint with salt crusted on my jersey felt like debugging life line by line. Brutal, messy, relentless… and somehow still worth it.

I rolled back home wrecked, dehydrated, and weirdly proud. Unsupported and unmotivated at the start, sure. But I finished. That’s the line of code that matters.
