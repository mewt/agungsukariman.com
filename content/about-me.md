The truth is, *Agung* was never meant to be my name. My mom wanted *Agus*, you know, the classic Indo name, mass-produced like mie instan 🍜. But maybe that’s the problem. Too many *Agus*es walking around. So my dad came through with *Agung*. Sounds like some Bali prince or gamelan prodigy… but nope. Just me. Not Balinese. Just… here.

*Sukariman*? That’s a whole other drama.

**SU** from *Sulastri*, my mom, the real MVP.  
**KARIM**, from the Karim family, who literally picked baby me up from the hospital when my parents were broke. No grab, no gojek, just pure kindness ❤️  
And **MAN**? That’s for *Basman*, my dad. Or as I like to call it… *Bestman*. Lols.

So yeah, even my name is a mashup of love, struggle, and last-minute decisions 🎲

I was supposed to be in a band 🎸. Or an esports team 🎮. Or I dunno, doing something that didn’t involve debugging tracking scripts at 2am. Not to mention that one dream: becoming a *Game Master* at Netmarble. Yup. I really thought I'd be managing MMORPG servers, banning cheaters, and giving away item codes like Oprah. Life said nope.

But here I am, writing, clicking, optimizing pixels, and biking long rides 🚴‍♂️ like I’m running away from my own roadmap.

Sometimes I look in the mirror and think: am I really living the life I thought I would? Probably not. But at least I’m still moving. Still me. Just weirder now.

This blog? Don’t expect perfection. Expect detours, noise, unfinished thoughts, and maybe a few dead jokes along the way 💀

Somewhere between the missed gigs and broken bikes, I picked up a different craft: making pixels tell the truth. Tracking stacks, campaign diagnostics, SEO on sites that swear they are “fine” until we open Search Console. If you need someone who can translate business goals into dashboards, fix the tags that feed them, and still speak human, that is the version of me you will meet here. The story is messy, but the work is sharp.
