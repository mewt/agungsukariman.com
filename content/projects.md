## Smart Salary
Employer branding campaigns needed to feed a nationwide hiring pipeline. I rebuilt the analytics foundation, stitched conversion APIs back into the CRM, and automated Looker Studio reports so HR and paid teams shared the same targets every week.

**Highlights**
- Lifted qualified applicant volume by 36% over three months without increasing spend  
- Connected Meta, Google, and LinkedIn campaign data to Salesforce for daily lead scoring  
- Delivered alerting that caught broken tracking within the first hour

## WeAreFum
A boutique cycling retailer needed clarity on every rupiah spent online. Together we cleaned GA4 and server-side tagging, deployed pixel health monitoring, and launched a quarterly optimisation structure that made creative testing routine.

**Highlights**
- Built product-level dashboards that merged Shopify, GA4, and Meta conversions  
- Automated campaign and SKU pacing reports with BigQuery + Apps Script  
- Improved return on ad spend by 28% by week six of consistent optimisation

## Other Collaborations
Beyond these flagship projects, I partner with founders and marketing teams on data migrations, attribution clean-ups, and “brownout” rescues when reporting silently fails. If your stack needs similar triage, [reach out.](/contact/)
