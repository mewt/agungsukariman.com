It all started with **Patrick** —  
Not a person. A bike.  
A *junk Chinese gravel bike* I bought for **600K** from the cursed depths of **Shitpee** (yeah, ~~Shopee~~)

Before it was Patrick, it was just... tragic.  
White frame.  

**Shitty red decals** that looked like knock-off fire graphics.  
I thought stickers would save it.  
So I went full Jaksel-core: anime, fake brands, nonsense logos.  
**It looked worse.**

But I don’t know why…  
I *loved* that damn bike.  
Maybe because it didn’t care what it looked like.  
It just kept rolling — no questions asked.

Then came the pain rides:
- **Audax 200KM** — finished, but missed the cut-off. Still proud.
- **JBR (Jakarta Bronx ~~Border~~ Ride)** — my legs never forgave me, where bike lanes go to die.
- **GXID  a.k.a Jakarta  Ride** — routes designed by psychopaths with GPS.
- **Depok U-Series** — 130KM + 1300m elev. For fun? Nope. For trauma.

After all that, I said:  
> "You know what, this frame deserves better."

So I called **Psychloop** in Darmawangsa:  
> “Bro, repaint this thing. Name it Patrick.”

Boom. Patrick was born.  
A fresh coat of class over years of chaos.

While I was there, I made the dumbest smart move:  
Bought **MKS Solution** pedals — pure Japan smoothness.  
**2x the price of the MXL frame.**  
Worth it?  
Financially, no.  
Spiritually? Yes.

### Patrick’s Final Form:
- GRX 10-speed 🛠️  
- **Entity Expert 400mm dropbar** (clearance steal from Rodalink 🙏)  
- Dia-Compe bar-end shifters (retro + regret = realness)  
- TRP Spyre mechanical disc brakes  
- WTB 700x37 tires (thicc, slow, dramatic)  
- **Repainted & reborn as Patrick by Psychloop**  
- MKS Solution pedals (because why not go bankrupt?)  
- 600K MXL frame that survived hell and paint

---

### What I Learned:
- Don’t upgrade trash… unless you want a story  
- Love makes you do dumb things — like $80 pedals on a $40 frame  
- Stickers don’t fix ugly  
- Gravel ≠ comfort  
- Dumb bikes + dumber owners = beautiful chaos

**Dumb bike. Dumber owner. Still riding.**  
💚 Still broke. Still proud. Still here.
