The truth is, *Agung* was never meant to be my name. My mom wanted *Agus* — you know, the classic Indo name, mass-produced like mie instan 🍜. But maybe that’s the problem. Too many *Agus*es walking around. So my dad came through with *Agung*. Sounds like some Bali prince or gamelan prodigy… but nope. Just me. Not Balinese. Just… here.

*Sukariman*? That’s a whole other drama.

**SU** from *Sulastri*, my mom — the real MVP.  
**KARIM**, from the Karim family, who literally picked baby me up from the hospital when my parents were broke. No grab, no gojek, just pure kindness ❤️  
And **MAN**? That’s for *Basman*, my dad. Or as I like to call it… *Bestman*. Lols.

So yeah, even my name is a mashup of love, struggle, and last-minute decisions 🎲

I was supposed to be in a band 🎸. Or an esports team 🎮. Or I dunno, doing something that didn’t involve debugging tracking scripts at 2am. Not to mention that one dream — becoming a *Game Master* at Netmarble. Yup. I really thought I'd be managing MMORPG servers, banning cheaters, and giving away item codes like Oprah. Life said nope.

But here I am — writing, clicking, optimizing pixels, and biking long rides 🚴‍♂️ like I’m running away from my own roadmap.

Sometimes I look in the mirror and think: am I really living the life I thought I would? Probably not. But at least I’m still moving. Still me. Just weirder now.

This blog? Don’t expect perfection. Expect detours, noise, unfinished thoughts, and maybe a few dead jokes along the way 💀
